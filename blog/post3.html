<p>I did 2 sudoku problems today. The first one went well, but the second one I
messed up on. Until very recently, I would have looked and looked at it until I
found where I went wrong. But realizing that I'm doing these puzzles to chill
out and reset before I start my 151B homework allowed me to just put it down. So
what if it's not going to get finished! So what if it'll never get completed. I
have to be okay with that, and I WILL be okay with that.</p>

<p>I watched Leonardo DiCaprio in Martin Scorsese's <strong>The aviator</strong>. It was a
fantastic movie. Inspiring, and scary. I felt like I was watching a rip off of
Steve Job or Elon Musk's life, until I realized that Howard Hughes was a real
person. A real fucking person, and so many affects of the movie could have been
pulled STRAIGHT from the Wikipedia page on him and into the movie's script. What
a fantastic film. The Spruce Goose was real! Aluminium shortages during the war
literally made some dude build that. That dude was Howard Hughes. That <em>dude</em>
did all sorts of other stuff, too.</p>

<p>The aspect, that part of him, that made him come up with brilliant ideas, it
made him come up with some goddamned crazy ones, too. He couldn't separate work
from life, which is something that a ton of people struggle with.</p>

<p>The stuff that the Upper-Ups tell children doesn't make the children perfect
people. That's something obvious, of course, but there's a difference between
being given a fact that you believe and a proof. Many of the things that Made
Hughes terrible and unhappy also made him better and more powerful. It wasn't
even like he was trying to treat people terribly, he just did what he thought
was right.</p>

<p>The amount of times that he told people 'figure it out' when he himself wouldn't
have been able to do it was astounding. And what was more astounding was how
often it worked out for everyone.</p>

<p>I'm using vim to edit these, still. I'm incredibly happy that I'm learning to
use things. Just now, I put <code>runtime ftplugin/text.vim</code> in my
<code>ftplugin/markdown.vim</code> file. That was a mistake, and I'll remove it later, but
it was a proper use of the <code>runtime</code> ex command, which I've never had the
opportunity to use before! I have <em>something</em> turned on in my initialization
files (<code>.bashrc</code> and the like) that allows me to expand variables into their
full paths. Meaning, something like <code>$HOME/Desk``&lt;Tab&gt;</code> will turn into
<code>/Users/ari/Desktop/</code>. I tried using <code>&lt;C-x&gt;&lt;C-f&gt;</code> to filename complete the line
<code>source $VIMRUNTIME/ftp</code>, and I realized that it put my system's installation of
vim in! <code>/usr/local/share/vim/vim81/</code>. Not portable! So I was very pleased to be
able to properly use <code>runtime</code>.</p>

<p>Another setting for tab completion that I'm very happy that I have is for the
wildmenu. From my vimrc:</p>

<pre><code>" Nicer &lt;Tab&gt;'ing in command mode.
" Select the dummy 0th item to remove text from the most recent completion
set wildmenu
set wildmode=longest:full,full
</code></pre>

<p>It feels right! I love it. People build complicated systems because everyone has
a different opinion on what 'right' is ! Take the community push behind
prettier.js, for example. No one really thinks its the best way to format code,
but EVERYone appreciates that everyone else follows a standard. I'd rather have
everyone else follow a standard than write code I can't read, even if it means
that I have to follow the same goddamnmed stupid standard. So, for something
like vim where you have reeters like myself using it, every feature gets a knob,
dial, lever, or switch. It's honestly overwhelming, and you have to learn
slowly.</p>

<p>But then when you find your groove, you're editing at the speed of thought. But
you're not learning anymore, and I miss that! I miss learning about vim and
being wowed. I haven't had the opportunity to use vim in a while, so I'm just
happy to be able to type this lil post out :)</p>

<p>And my learning is even more improved by doing a piece of text editing that I'm
not used to. Writing C code might not be as fun. Or, even if I was writing in a
new medium where I have much more obvious stuff to learn (I love low-hanging
fruit, ok? Nothing wrong with that :']). ANYway, if I was writing text where I
had much to learn but I was stressed or pressed for time or not in the right
mood, I wouldn't enjoy taking these fun detours. But the perfect storm of me
chillin out allowed me to fully appreciate this windfall.</p>

<p>Nice. Tame Impala, Kishi Bashi, chillin with vim tmux and a blog that I'm
writing or something, and I'm grooving. Keep it up, and get back here when
you're lost. This day is the genesis of the playlist 'The Law'</p>

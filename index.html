        <h1 id="myprojects">My projects</h1>
            <p>These are all lil projects that I've made throughout my time at UCLA. None of them have been very time consuming, but each one taught me a lot.</p>
        <h2>Vector Calculator – <a href="https://arisweedler.github.io/vectorCalculator/">link</a></h2>
            <p>My first experience with JavaScript. (A friend did the HTML and styling. Made at a 12-hour beginner hackathon)</p>
        <h2>Typing Test – <a href="https://arisweedler.github.io/Typing-Test/">link</a></h2>
            <p>My first experience with HTML</p>
        <h2>Matrix reduced row echelon form calculator – <a href="https://arisweedler.github.io/matrix-rref-solver/">link</a></h2>
            <p>This one's pretty cool, my first experience with React.</p>
        <h2>Displaying SVG animations using React – <a href="https://arisweedler.github.io/bodymovin-HOC/">link</a></h2>
            <p>My friend made an animation and wanted to know how to get it to display on her website. I wanted to see if I could help.</p>
        <h2>I copied a <a href="https://tympanus.net/codrops/2016/04/26/the-aviator-animating-basic-3d-scene-threejs/">tutorial</a>. – <a href="https://arisweedler.github.io/THREE-js-test/">link</a></h2>
            <p>I did a lot of copying code here, so I felt like I had to add the sun (with a directional light attached) to prove that I learned something. (I also left the wireframe visible cuz I think it looks cool :P )</p>
        <h2>Playing around with three.js more – <a href="https://arisweedler.github.io/THREE-js-Neuron/">link</a></h2>
            <p>I thought that it'd maybe be neat if I could make a 3D 1st person shooter, then I realized that if I ever wanted to make a game like this then I'd wanna download Unity or something like that.</p>
        <h2>Game I made with a friend in high school! – <a href="https://github.com/AriSweedler/conway">link</a></h2>
            <p>This one isn't hosted anywhere. I wish applets weren't outdated... This was a ton of fun to make!</p>

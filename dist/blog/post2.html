<p>I just watched I Am Legend, and read some stuff from <a href="sandymaguire.me">sandymaguire.me</a>. I have thoughts.</p>

<h2 id="i">I</h2>

<p>I didn't love I Am Legend. Will Smith is a really good actor, and I loved him in The Pursuit of Happiness and other stuff, but I just didn't love the movie's plot that much. I didn't find it compelling and I found myself vacillating between stressed and bored, which wasn't very fun. Reading the wikipedia entry on the book that it's loosely based on was cool. The original book had some really novel ideas which I thought were totally cool.</p>

<p>I looked up Fallout afterwards, and learned a little bit about that game and its derivatives. It's crazy. The age of a single dude building an entire game engine is kinda over, unless it's some seriously indie stuff.</p>

<p>When I was reading the Fallout wiki, I had an idea, and I thought it was fun and cool so I'm writing it down. The premise is character select - you have to choose 1 of 3. But instead of having a menu where you select from 1 of 3 characters, it's something like you're playing as a community leader and you're moderating (well not moderating, taking part in?) a discussion about who's most fit for the game's main task. And you have to like, convince your people which character is the best for the job. So instead of clicking on "the charismatic guy" you'd click 1 of 3 dialogue options that says "I think that charisma will help the most". Obviously there'd be much better writing in a good implementation of this mechanic. But I think the mechanic is cool and would be novel and fun once.</p>

<p>More than once and I dunno if I'd like it - it's an indirect way to give the player choice, so people are clearly going to know that. And then if they want to choose one character over the other, they'll choose the corresponding dialogue option and completely not be immersed in the roleplaying that this mechanic is based on, which would be worse than not having it at all. Anyway, I thought it was fun and wanted to document.</p>

<p>I like the way that Sandy just used roman numerals to separate the parts of his writing. Like, that's where his brain had dividers, so that's where his text has dividers. I thought it was an extremely elegant (super simple, super good) way to convey information. And it's kinda cute!</p>

<p>Sandy's post '<a href="https://sandymaguire.me/blog/teaching-badly/">Teaching Badly</a>' felt like reading Atlas Shrugged. It explained an idea that's been wiggling around in the back of my head since forever. It felt cathartic to read his words, like the second time I read The Hacker's Manifesto. My dad always tells me that the best ideas are ones that make you say "oh my gosh, that's so simple, why hasn't anyone thought of that before!?". Sandy's essay on teaching badly articulated ideas. And oh my gosh! It's so true and obvious, why why haven't I/hasn't anyone articulated those ideas to me before! I relate to what he was saying so so so much.</p>

<p>Also, his site was humbly attractive, which I think is the best. It's not overengineered, yet there was nothing I found immediately lacking.</p>

<p>I love the great educators like Ben Eater or 3Blue1Brown. I don't know what to do about my appreciation for them. The desire to produce a fantastic and timeless educational piece drives me - but I have no direction in terms of creating something like that right now. I need to learn more first.</p>

<p>I believe that the inability to articulate or recognize thoughts like this is a problem that can be solved. Self-confidence and admitting when you don't know things are both hugely important.</p>

<p>I've got some homework to do, and my motivation is running out. I guess I don't feel like I'm learning anything from this class. Which is boring, but whatever. The quarter is almost over and I CANNOT wait to go back to Illumio.</p>

<p>I kinda wanna improve my site a lil more, but I don't care a ton. I'm writing these for me. I can throw some CSS styling (maybe even a bootstrap thing) at this and probably have it look decent. I kinda wanna play with using CSS variables, and then using JS to modify the CSS variables, that might be neat. Out of place, but neat. Alternatively, I could just mimic what I did for Maya's </p>

<h3 id="abinaryviewoftheworldandradicalization">A binary view of the world and radicalization</h3>

<p>On a scale of 0 to 1, if a person's opinion is at a 0, it's very hard to
convince them to believe 1. You can tell them the same thing every day, and
their minds won't change until they decide to listen. When there's a binary
view, it's very hard to stop people from hunkering down into an 'us vs. them'
type mindset.</p>

<p>But on a scale of 0 to 9, if a person's opinion is at a 4 and you want them to
believe in 5, then that's not as tough. Now, you might claim that the single
quantized leap of opinion from 4 to 5 isn't as large as the single quantized
leap of opinion from 0 to 1, but that's not necessarily true. This is where
radical opinions come into play. To convince a 4 to be a 5, arguing 5 to them is
a losing strategy. You should argue 9.</p>

<p>To get from point A to point B as fast as possible, you don't want to evenly
accelerate until you're there. You don't even wanna evenly accelerate until
you're halfway there then evenly decelerate until you've made it. You want to
INSTANTLY accelerate, INSTANTLY get there, and INSTANTLY stop. Obviously that
doesn't work in a real world situation, but that would be ideal in the perfect
scenario.</p>

<p>So when you want people to move, don't try to get them to accelerate slowly.
Jolt them. Jounce them. Crackle and Pop them. If you can talk sensically about
something more radical, and it's not just a cheaply used rhetorical device, then
you'd be a fool not to. When you haggle with someone, you don't start at the
highest price you're willing to pay!! We bargain like this, we even talk like
this, all the time! See what I did there? Hyperboles are powerful when they're
not stupid exaggerations. When they're stupid exaggerations, though, they're
more destructive than not knowing what you're talking about. So be careful.</p>

<p>So! To get someone to go from a 4 to a 5, or a 2 to a 6, or anything, it makes
logical sense to argue for 9. If the 'us vs. them' mindset groups 4 and 5
together to pit them against 9, then you've defeated that barrier. And some
mental barriers, unfortunately, don't give any respect logic, so you HAVE to use
tricks like this to disarm them and get people to at least hear what you're
saying. It's still up to them if they listen or not.</p>

<h2 id="ii">II</h2>

<p>So, why does this matter? When I think about the crazy stuff that I was taught
during religious school, in the context of this mindset, I feel more at ease.
The things I was taught make more sense as guidelines than as rules written in
stone. Of course! No one is supposed to take ancient religion word-for-word in a
modern society. Times change, and thus so should religion. Nothing is ACTUALLY
written in stone, except for the 10 commandments. And they're so general that
you can't HELP but liberally interpret them. "Thou shall not murder" doesn't
extend to animals, or acts of self-defense, or the microscopic organisms that we
might accidentally squish every time we blink or move. Breathing or walking is
not a sin, so we can't interpret "Thou shall not murder" so intensely.</p>

<p>But if we can't go all Kantian and take everything to the max, then where do we
draw the line? Where is the optimal location? Well, it's where the wisdom of our
ancestors dictates. If they say 9, then we should draw the line at 9. Murder is
not okay, jealousy should be avoided, parents should be respected. All of these
statements have varying interpretations, from useless and impossibly general at
level 0s to insane and radical at level 9. Level 9 interpretations, I'll call
them nineterpritations cuz I'm having fun thinking and journaling about this.</p>

<p>The religion I learned was a nineterpritation. That's a very different thing
than a lie! Well, no it's not. But let me explain what I mean. The religion I
learned was an untruth told for beneficial reasons. In fact, the people
propagating it might not even think they're pulling wool over my eyes by
propagating it. They could have an orthogonal and equally sensical
interpretation of why what they're saying is right. I justify what they're
saying by saying "even though it's a lie, it helps me and it helps them. It is
information shared out of love and respect, and I should treat the gift they're
giving me exactly like it is. A powerful tool that can better my life and the
lives of those around me, if used properly." They justify what they're saying
for one of a hundred reasons. "It's the truth", "Religion just wants you to be a
<em>good person</em> and <em>love your neighbor</em>", "<strong>treat others the way you want to be
treated</strong>", "<em>This gives me strength, and you rejecting it takes that strength away
from me</em>". The last one might be a subconscious thing, which makes it kinda a
tricky and fucked up situation. Not surprisingly, that's a common theme with
nineterpritations... They make people act WEIRD.</p>

<h3 id="ahorsetowater">A horse to water</h3>

<p>Never believe a nineterpritation, just argue for them. Does that seem like a
contradiction? I swear, it's not! Nineterpritations are just the best rhetorical
device ever. I'm sad, because I struggle to explain the thoughts I have around
these feelings and thinkings, and thus I can't really have an intelligent
conversation about this stuff. And I know that the burden of fixing my inability
to think is entirely upon me.</p>

<p>This journaling is my way to have a conversation with someone (myself, I
guess...) in a way that EVEN if I forget my thoughts, even if my beliefs exit
RAM and sit on Disk for an hour, I'll be able to pick up right where I leave
off.</p>

<p>So. A horse to water. It doesn't fit this chunk of thoughts, but I like the way
it sounds. I guess arguing a nineterpritation to someone would be like, instead
of bringing the horse to water and watching him not drink, you'd just throw the
horse in the middle of the river.</p>

<h2 id="iii">III</h2>

<p>Yeah. So the more I talk about nineterpritations, the more I realize how much I
feel hurt by them. The things in my life that were nineterpreted to me made me
feel crazy. I can understand and respect societal nineterpritations to some
degree, because I society doesn't always act in favor of the individual. (For
example, criminals are exiles, when it would be in their best interest for them
to go free. Clearly, it's not in society's best interest, and what is society by
a collection of individuals, so it's not an evil thing to punish criminals).</p>

<p>But just imagine! What if religious society has a competitive advantage in terms
of survival of the fittest. What would that entail about nineterpreting the
religion. Then the non-believers are like the "criminals". It will be in the
society's best interest to have them exiled, shunned, or forced to leave. To
contrast with the evil nineterpritations, we can call these criminals (criminals
in terms of the society they were born into, they clearly haven't done anything
wrong other than not believe dogma) "Zeroes". Or, we could call them
protestants. Yeah, the idea that I'm having isn't unique. I might just be
explaining it or thinking about it in a novel way.</p>

<p>There's no older method of thought than rebelling against the man. When people
are unhappy, they wanna blame everyone BUT themselves, and sometimes that turns
them into liars. It's easy to dismiss unhappy people as weak or lazy. But I'm
not weak, I'm not lazy, and I won't be unhappy for long. Hah haaaa!</p>

<h2 id="mytakeawayfromlisteningtomyselframbletoday">My takeaway from listening to myself ramble today</h2>

<p>So, I'm asking myself. What did I learn about <strong>me</strong> today? I learned that <strong>I'm
actually still bothered by the bullshit that happened in Hebrew school still.</strong>
I've never talked to my mom about it because when it was bothering me, that was
her only connection to Bubbe. And I haven't talked to my dad about it because I
never respected these thoughts enough to bring it up to him. That is, I
unfortunately didn't care what I thought about religion. I wonder what he really
thinks about religion. It seems he's just able to be fine without talking or
thinking about it. Some stuff just doesn't bother some people, I guess. I'm a
little bit more sensitive than he is. I haven't talked to my sister about this
because I unfortunately didn't care what she has to say about religion. Until
writing this, that is. I realized that by not asking her I was wasting a
potentially valuable resource. I won't ask her about it via any other method
than a face to face conversation though. I'd laugh if she read this and asked me
about it.</p>

<p>I learned that <strong>I want to have a converstaion about religion with my sister</strong>,
and I want to further inspect my thoughts on the matter. I want to do this in a
vacuum, so I can't handle other people's interpretation on this stuff, I'll be
too easily influenced or distracted or cowed. I want to discover the full depths
of what my natural opinion is before trusting someone else's interpretation. I
don't expect to come to the best interpretation, but I do want to think deeply
about this before I reform another opinion.</p>

<p>I learned that <strong>my theory about nineterpritations was really just a way for me
to justify Hebrew school</strong>. I'm sending my kids to Hebrew school too, lol. Trump
nineterprets. Or, ninesplains. I like the parallelism with the phrase 'dressed
to the nines'.</p>

<h2 id="iv">IV</h2>

<p>I wonder if someone reading this will think I'm crazy, or understand what I'm
saying! I think that Joc would understand what I'm saying, and I'm not just
saying that cuz she's really pretty. I'm saying that exclusively because she's
understood and responded to similarly outlandish thoughts of mine in the past.
I'd like to think that Lavi or maybe even Darek would also understand what I'm
saying, cuz they're pretty woke sometimes. But I don't know. I would be
pleasantly surprised if Lavi did. I would be surprised if Darek <em>didn't</em>
understand me, actually. But he's way more radical than me, so of course my
opinion should be encompassed in his. I don't know if I could converse with him
about this, as he'd convince me of something. Maddie sure as hell wouldn't
understand what I'm saying, and that's the goddamned tragedy of it all.</p>

<p>Moving forward, <strong>I won't take offense or get mad when someone ninesplains to me.
I'll merely recognize that they're doing it, and try to understand their
motives.</strong> If the motives apply properly to me, if I'm not a zero, a criminal, a
soon-to-be-protestant, then I'll gladly follow them. If under their
ninesplanation I'm a criminal, then I won't let them disrespect me. I'll do my
goddamned best to be reasonable and respectful and responsible and all the other
things that I think good humans should be to each other, but I won't drink the
water without thinking long and hard about it first. I won't think 9, but I
could definitely be convinced to think 5, or 6, or even 7. In fact, if 8 and 9
are reasonable opinions, I wouldn't be opposed to calling them my own. I'll just
be careful before I let myself get thrown into the river.</p>

<h2 id="v">V</h2>

<p>I'll end this entry with something less thinky. The roman numeral for 5 and the
qwerty-keyboard capitalization of 6 are opposite. See???:</p>

<pre><code>   ROMAN NUMERAL FOR FIVE: V
QWERTY KEYBOARD SHIFT SIX: ^
</code></pre>

<p>From now on, if I ever get to section 6, I'll use ^ instead of VI. Maybe I'll
even write stuff like <code>Engineering VI</code> as <code>Engineering ^</code>, my own little version
of Shir and Elan's <code>y2k</code> joke. Sundak</p>

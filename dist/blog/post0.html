<h1 id="blogpost0">Blog Post 0</h1>

<p>Yeah, we're starting from 0. That's who I am. Counting from 0 makes a few things easier. This is going to be some stream of consciousness-type stuff. I wonder what the best way to embed images is, I wanna make it clear that I'm at the far left of this <a href="https://www.ideate.nl/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/design-thinking-process.gif">image</a> in this blog post.</p>

<p>See, I normally write stuff in vim, but I'm writing this with VSCode. That's because it's a larger project, so it kinda makes sense. But vim is a better text editor, it'll spell check better and give me more tools to edit text efficiently.</p>

<h2 id="whatiwantfrommyvimmarkdownsetup">What I want from my vim/markdown setup:</h2>

<p>1) Keymapping to render what markdown will look like in a vertical split window</p>

<p>1) Good markdown syntax highlighting (this should be trivial)</p>

<p>1) I don't wanna hard-wrap lines. That is, I should either turn off <code>textwidth</code> or <code>set formatoptions-=a</code>. As of now, I still want the characters I'm  typing to soft-wrap at like 80 or so columns, but who knows if I'll want that when I have a more educated opinion of editing markdown.</p>

<h2 id="whatiwantfrompublishingstuff">What I want from publishing stuff</h2>

<p>A good workflow. Something low-friction, where the only barrier between me publishing a blog post is writing it. That sounds simple and easy, and as the limit of 'number of blog posts written' approaches infinity, friction will naturally tend towards 0. But there's an optimal route to achieve this frictionless environment, and I don't know what it is. I want the limit of 'friction' as 'blog posts written' approaches 1 to tend to 0. In a perfect system, doing something once makes it easily and infinitely repeatable. That is, I want the integral of the friction over time function to approach 0, not just the value of the friction over time function to approach 0.</p>

<p>Less on the techincal-code side, and more on the mental/technical-writing side, I want my writing skills to improve. While I do believe it's naive to expect to achieve the perfectly frictionless technical transition, I don't think it's an impossible task. Achieving a perfectly frictionless writing-ability transition is clearly impossible, and thus shouldn't even be a potential goal when calculating a cost model for working on this stuff.</p>

<p>I'm writing this blog post fully expecting to feel like I'm sitting in the mud at the end of it. But I'll keep getting on the horse until I feel confident enough to recognize what works and what doesn't work when writing posts. This will be a journal, of sorts. A compendium of lessons I've learned, with the bad bits trimmed off. I want to explain systems in the most efficient and understandable way possible, because it feels good to do that.</p>

<h2 id="ok">Ok!</h2>

<p>I want to have all the bells and whistles possible attached to this blog. I want to enjoy writing these. I want other people to enjoy reading them. As you can see, there's really nothing unique about my desires. And there probably won't be anything particularly unique about my workflow. But there's nothing unique in playing soccer, or going to the gym, or eating your vitamins, or doing your homework, either.</p>

<p>Here's to whatever comes of this.</p>

					<p>I'm Ari Sweedler. I like a few things about computers. I'm a third year at UCLA, I play club frisbee and I'm a member of Theta Chi fraternity. I'm not unique, I like learning cool things. I'm a vim enthusiast, I know a lil bit about web dev, and I wanna learn more about building linux systems.</p>

					<h3><a href="https://www.tidalscale.com/">TidalScale</a></h3>
					<h6>IT intern</h6>
					<p>This was my genesis. I learned that computers don't need to have screens or keyboards. I learned what a shell was, I learned the difference between a port (transport layer) and a port (what you put a plug into). I also learned what the OSI model was. I learned the difference between a server (a program that stays running and serves information as a response to queries) and a server (a machine that runs server programs). I learned a lot. This was hard, and I was not useful, but it was exciting. It empowered me.</p>

				<div class="job job-2">
					<h3>Illumio</h3>
					<h6>Software Engineering intern</h6>
					<p>I did some real work. I learned about FOSS. For 2 weeks I read code and tried to understand what the company did. Then I extended a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of the company's functionality. And I did a good job of it. I'm not kidding about the fraction^3 part. The copmany's product has a few subsystems, and each subsystem has a few subsystems. I extended one of those.</p>
